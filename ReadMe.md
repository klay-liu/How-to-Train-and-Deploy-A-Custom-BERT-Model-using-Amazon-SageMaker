### How to Train and Deploy A Custom BERT Model using Amazon SageMaker

Amazon Sagemaker is a machine learning platform for every developer and data scientist which enables developers to create, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models in the cloud[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_SageMaker#cite_note-:6-2)and also enables developers to deploy ML models on embedded systems and edge-devices.Sagemaker offers built-in algorithms and scripting modes for training models.

## Content

This post will focus on building and deploying a custom BERT model in script mode based on my experience in my daily work.
You should write a model training script and a submission script to train the model before using Sagemakerâ€™s script mode. The following sections make up the content of this post:

0. Dataset used in the post

1. Train a BERT model in Sagemaker
2. Deploy/Host a trained model in Sagemaker
3. How to create Sagemaker jobs with Submission Script
